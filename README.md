🧠 HedgeVision: Hedge Fund Return Prediction
HedgeVision is a machine learning-powered application designed to predict hedge fund return performance, categorizing funds into risk/return buckets (e.g., High Gain, Neutral, Low Gain). Built as part of the ISA 514 Big Data course, the project blends structured hedge fund metrics with economic indicators to create actionable insights for investors, fund managers, and analysts.
